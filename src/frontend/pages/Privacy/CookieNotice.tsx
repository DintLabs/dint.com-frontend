Dint Club Inc (collectively, “Dint Club,” “we,” “us,” “our”) respect your privacy and are committed to protecting the personal data we hold about you. By using our website located at www.dint.com (the “Services”) with your browser set to accept cookies, you consent to our use of cookies and other technologies to provide the Services to you as described in this notice and in our Privacy Notice. For more information about what cookies and pixel tags are, what they do, and how you can opt out of, manage, or delete them, please review this Cookie Notice.
<br /><br />
WHAT ARE COOKIES?
<br /><br />
“Cookies” are small strings of text or computer code stored locally on your device that allow us, ad networks, and our third-party service providers, to identify your browser and/or device as you browse the Internet. Cookies can be placed, read, and/or written to by our Services, or other websites or services that recognize a particular cookie, which allows the website to “remember” or “recognize” a particular browser or device and, in some cases, store information about that browser or device.
<br /><br />
Certain types of cookies or cookie-like functionality may be placed or activated through browser add-ons, including, but not limited to, Adobe Flash. While these cookies are stored differently, their functionality and purpose is generally similar to other cookies.
<br /><br />
For more information about cookies, please see www.allaboutcookies.org.
<br /><br />
HOW LONG ARE COOKIES STORED ON MY SYSTEM?
<br /><br />
Session Cookies. “Session cookies” are stored for the duration of a browser session; when you close the browser, the cookie is deleted.

Persistent Cookies. “Persistent cookies” are stored for a preset amount of time (often between 90 days and two years, depending on the application) and are typically not deleted when a browser session is closed.
<br /><br />
Your choices may affect whether we use session or persistent cookies for a particular application. For example, if you select “Remember Me,” your two-step verification status is stored on a persistent cookie for 30 days to remember the device that you signed in from.
<br /><br />
WHAT COOKIES DO WE USE, AND WHY?
<br /><br />
Necessary Cookies. Some cookies are necessary to allow you to browse the Services and access certain pages. Necessary cookies are required for the Services (or certain functionality on the Services) to work properly, and we do not use these cookies to collect personal data about you.
<br /><br />
Cookie Name	More Information
auth_id	authenticate user ID
auth_uid_43	hash to remember two-factor authentication
Disabling or removing these cookies may prevent the Services, or certain functionality on the Services, from working correctly or at all.
<br /><br />
Performance Cookies. We use performance cookies to collect information about how our users use and interact with the Services, such as what pages are visited most often, how the Services are used and function, or how users navigate the Services. We use this information to improve the Services and their content. These cookies only collect aggregate information about the use of the Services, and thus do not collect information that can be used to identify you personally. Examples include:
<br /><br />
Cookie Name	More Information
sess	session cookie; contains a unique identifier for your device
csrf	csrf token
fp	browser fingerprint
ref_src	source of referral ID
ref	referral user ID
Disabling or removing these cookies generally does not interfere with the functionality or performance of the Services.
<br /><br />
Functionality Cookies. We use functionality cookies to remember information that you have provided or choices you have made on the Services, such as saving your logged-in status or site preferences. This allows us to provide a more personalized and convenient browsing experience.
<br /><br />
Disabling or removing these cookies may make browsing the Services less convenient or may prevent certain functionality from working correctly.
<br /><br />
Third-Party Functionality. We do not have access to or control over cookies or other features that third party sites may use, and the information practices of those third party websites are not covered by our Privacy Notice or this Cookie Notice. For more information about how Stripe and Securion collect and use information about your activities, please review their applicable terms of service and privacy policies.
<br /><br />
HOW DO I CONTROL OR MAKE CHOICES ABOUT COOKIES AND TRACKING TECHNOLOGIES?
<br /><br />
Managing Cookies. Most browsers automatically accept cookies by default, but you can adjust your device and/or browser settings to delete and/or block some or all cookies, or provide notifications when you receive a new cookie. Consult the “Help,” “Tools,” or “Preferences” menus on your browser, or the documentation for your device, for more information about how to do this. Please note, however, that blocking or deleting certain cookies may negatively affect your user experience.
<br /><br />
Additionally, you can generally disable or delete cookies placed and used by browser add-ons, such as Adobe Flash cookies, by changing the add-on settings or visiting the website of its provider. Information and controls that allow you to manage Adobe Flash cookies may be found on this page:
<br /><br />

<br /><br />
Note that if you disable Adobe Flash cookies or similar technologies, you may not have access to certain features and services (such as consistent volume settings for videos) that make your online experience more efficient and/or enjoyable.
